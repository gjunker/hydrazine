Name : TestSerializableArchive

Description : Make sure that the implementation of a Serializable
archive works as intended.
Make sure that the performance is also reasonable.  Compare
to the boost serialization library.  This should test and benchmark saving to
a buffer then immediately restoring, saving to and restoring from disk,
and saving to an archive, sending the archive over mpi, and restoring at the
other end.
