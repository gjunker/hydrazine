Name : TestMath

Description : 
A simple test for the functions in math.cpp.  These use
bitwise operations to do fast power of 2 operations, this
test benchmarks the operations and tests them against
equivalent slower implemenations.


Test time : 0.151288

Status : Correctly detected 1 as a power of two.
Correctly detected 2 as a power of two.
Correctly detected 4 as a power of two.

Description : Make sure that the implementation of a Serializable
archive works as intended.
Make sure that the performance is also reasonable.  Compare
to the boost serialization library.  This should test and benchmark saving to
a buffer then immediately restoring, saving to and restoring from disk,
and saving to an archive, sending the archive over mpi, and restoring at the
other end.

Test time : 0.0546

Status : SerializableArchive average save/load time for 1000 iterations: 2.04802e-07 seconds.
SerializableArchive average save/load time for 1000 iterations: 5.42107e-05 seconds.
